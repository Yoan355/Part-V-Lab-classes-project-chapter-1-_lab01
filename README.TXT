It is discussed in chapter 1.

The purpose of this project is to illustrate object interaction and to examine
some simple code. See chapters one and three of the book.

To use this project, create some Student objects, then create a LabClass object.
Add the students to the class using the "enrolStudent" method. Print a class
list.


My explanations: 
By calling getName() the system prompts you the names of the students.

24. Call the numberOfStudents method of that class. What does it do?
    By calling this method it returns number of students enrolled in the lab class.

31. What are the types of the following values?
Int 0
String “hello”
Int 101
Int -1
Boolean true
String “33”
Float 3.1415

Bullet 36. An object cannot have several classes. Each object is an instance of one specific class.
